Hello, this is a project I have been working on for this last semester. I was tasked on using opengl to create models and shapes in 3D using only code. 
After completing the project to have shapes I was tasked on creating a game. I personally have found opengl to be a challenge and have not completed this.
I have however done my best to include as much knowledge within this project as I could.
