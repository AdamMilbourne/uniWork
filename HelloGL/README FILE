Hello, this is a project i have been working on for this last semester. i was tasked on using opengl to create models and shapes in 3D using only code. 
after completing the project to have shapes i was tasked on creating a game. I personally have found opengl to be a challange and have not completed this.
I have however done my best to include as much knowledge within this project as i could.
